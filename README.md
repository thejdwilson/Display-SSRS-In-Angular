# DisplaySsrs

# What is this project for?

I needed to display some SSRS reports within our webscreens. This is a clean, simple way using iframes. One requirement was to limit/prevent the users from accessing the SSRS web portal. It seems that this method helps to hide where it's pulling the reports from.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
